# Solution

This problem is pretty easy once you get the idea. I was pretty confuse at first too. We can solve this problem by assigning two pointer. Pointer 1 traverse the entire list and pointer 2 will go after the first character of the duplicate when a duplicate is found. We then can calculate the length in each iteration and get the highest length.

Time Complexity: **O(n)**\
Space Complexity: **O(n)**
