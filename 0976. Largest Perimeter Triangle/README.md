# Solution

Initially I did not understand this problem but after doing some research I found that a zero-area triangle means that it must be able to comply with these rules -> a + b > c, a + c > b and a + b > c. After you got this, you can just sort the array and check the numbers in the array then return the triangle with the largest perimeter.


Time Complexity: **O(n log n)**\
Space Complexity: **O(1)**
