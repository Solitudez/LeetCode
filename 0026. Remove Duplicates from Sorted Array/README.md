# Solution

This problem is pretty easy. Make a pointer pointing the first element of the array then loop through the rest of the list, if the value is not equal to the pointer then change the value after the pointer to be equal the new value. 

Time Complexity: **O(n)**\
Space Complexity: **O(1)**
