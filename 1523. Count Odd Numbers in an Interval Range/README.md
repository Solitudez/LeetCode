# Solution

One of the most simplest problem. If both of them are even numbers then we can do (high - low) / 2 else (high - low) / 2 + 1. 

Ex: <br>
8 to 10 (Even numbers) <br>
(10 - 8) / 2 = 1 (odd num: 9)

3 to 7 (Odd numbers) <br>
(7 - 3) / 2 + 1 = 3 (odd nums: 3, 5, 7)

8 to 13 (one odd, one even)<br>
(13 - 8) / 2 + 1 = 3 (odd nums: 9, 11, 13)

Time Complexity: **O(1)**\
Space Complexity: **O(1)**
